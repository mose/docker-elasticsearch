docker-elasticsearch
====================

Based on faria-basedock which contains supervisord, sshd, rsyslogd, crond already.

This build also includes elasticsearch-HQ from http://www.elastichq.org/

The version I need is 0.90.5 but it can be changed in the Dockerfile. It's used for dev that's why dat dir is contained.
